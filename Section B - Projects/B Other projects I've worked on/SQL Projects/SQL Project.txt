Project: App impersonator
Google Classroom
Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.
Your project is now marked as complete. You can continue working on it, of course, if you think of other ways to improve it. Keep practicing!

 CREATE TABLE health (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, food TEXT, weight INTEGER);

INSERT INTO health (food, weight) VALUES ("Banana", "72");
INSERT INTO health (food, weight) VALUES ("Chocolate", "73");
INSERT INTO health (food, weight) VALUES ("Celery", "71");
INSERT INTO health (food, weight) VALUES ("Chick Peas", "70");
INSERT INTO health (food, weight) VALUES ("Brownies", "71");

SELECT * FROM health; 

UPDATE health SET food = "Chocolate Coated Chick Peas" WHERE food = "Chick Peas";

SELECT * FROM health;

DELETE FROM health WHERE food = "Celery" ;

SELECT * FROM health;
